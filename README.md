Kanban Board
A real-time, full-stack Kanban board built with React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO for task management and collaboration. This app allows users to create, update, delete, and move tasks between columns with a drag-and-drop interface.
Deployment: https://kanban-eight-pi.vercel.app/
Note: There is a 50-second delay when adding the first card in the app. The card will take this time to be displayed after itâ€™s created. This delay only occurs during the first card creation. Subsequent cards will appear immediately without any delay.

Features

Task Management: Create, edit, delete tasks, and drag them between columns (To Do, In Progress, Done).
File Attachments: Attach files to tasks to keep relevant information organized.
Priority and Category Settings: Set priority and categories for each task to better manage workflow.
Task Progress Visualization: View task progress with a simple chart.
